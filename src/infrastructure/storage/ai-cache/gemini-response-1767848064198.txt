    "correctIndex": "B",
    "explanation": "The text states that Web2 is 'readable and writable network' enabling user engagement but 'is plagued by issues concerning the collection and storage of users’ personal data on third-party platforms.' In contrast, Web3 'not only supports readable and writable but also ensures that users maintain ownership of their data' and is known as the 'read-write-own' web because 'it empowers users to retain ownership of their data.'",

When interacting with a Web3 application, users are typically presented with a wallet interface containing complex strings, which can be confusing and result in potential asset loss. For example, a user may inadvertently sign a “setApprovalForAll” transaction... if he or she cannot understand the transaction details, resulting in the transfer of all his or her assets to another party.'
