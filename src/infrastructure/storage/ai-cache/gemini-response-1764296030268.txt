This suggests that weak institutional quality decreases the market and accounting performance firms in Nigeria.\" For 'institutional quality' to be 'negatively related' and for 'weak quality' to 'decrease performance', it implies that the 'institutional quality' variable used in the regression is conceptualized such that a higher value represents greater weakness or problems (as explicitly done for robustness, where 'higher value depicting severe problems'). Thus, as 'weakness' (higher variable value) increases, performance decreases (negative relationship).",
