    "explanation": "The text explicitly states in section 3.2.1, 'Therefore, our result fails to support the “grease the wheels” claims of corruption and performance of firms.

Except for regulatory quality, other institutional environment indices are positively related to Tobin Q' and 'All the indices are positively related to ROA except for the regulatory quality.'
