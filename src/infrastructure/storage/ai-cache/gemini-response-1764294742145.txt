    "question": "According to the study's main findings, what is the overall relationship between corruption perception, institutional quality, and the performance of listed companies in Nigeria?",
    "options": [
      { "id": "A", "value": "Both corruption perception and weak institutional quality are negatively related to market value (TobinQ) and accounting value (ROA)." },

    "correctIndex": "A",
    "explanation": "The abstract states: 'We find that corruption is negatively related to the market value (TobinQ) and accounting value performance (ROA). Similarly, institutional quality is negatively related to TobinQ and ROA. The results suggest that corruption and institutional quality weaken the market and accounting performance firms in Nigeria.'

      { "id": "A", "value": "Financial firms are more vulnerable to corruption, while non-financial firms are more affected by weak institutional environments." },
      { "id": "B", "value": "Corruption and weak institutional environments tend to impair the performance of non-financial firms more, due to less regulatory oversight compared to financial institutions." },

    ],
    "correctIndex": "B",
    "explanation": "The abstract and conclusion state: 'We find that both corruption and weak institutional environment tend to impair the market and accounting-based performance of non-financial firms, which could be traced to the less regulatory body in such institution compared to the financial institution.' This directly supports option B.",

    "question": "The study utilized two different indices for corruption perception: the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index (CPI) and the World Bank Control of Corruption Index (CCI). How were these indices specifically adapted for consistency with the study's statistical model?",
    "options": [
      { "id": "A", "value": "Both CPI and CCI were rescaled to range from 0 to 100, with higher values consistently indicating lower corruption." },
      { "id": "B", "value": "CPI was reversed to indicate higher corruption with higher values, while CCI was rescaled and re-geared to also show higher corruption with higher values." },
      { "id": "C", "value": "CPI was kept in its original 0-100 range (lower value = higher corruption), but CCI was reversed to match this interpretation." },
      { "id": "D", "value": "Both indices were used in their original formats without any rescaling or reversal to maintain data integrity." }
    ],
    "correctIndex": "B",
    "explanation": "Section 2.2.2 'Corruption perception' states: 'Recently, Transparency International has rescaled the Index ranging 0–100 with lower value depicting higher corruption. For consistency with the study model, we reverse the Index with a higher value indicating sophisticated corruption.' And for CCI: 'To avoid inconsistency with the statistical model, we rescale the Index and re-gear the index ranging 0–10 with the lower value indicating minimized corruption and vice-versa.' This means higher values for both adapted indices indicate higher corruption, supporting option B.",

Introduction, paragraph 9 states: 'Besides, we find that the governance indicators of political instability and violence, gov-ernment effectiveness, rule of law, voice and accountability except for regulatory quality, other institutional environment indices are positively related to both market and accounting-based performance.'

Introduction, paragraph 10 describes two strands: one that 'assesses corruption as an impediment to economic growth' and another that 'term corruption as 'grease the wheel' supports the postulation that corruption tends to speed up the wheels of business'.

    "explanation": "In Section 3.2.1 'Corruption and performance', it states: 'We find that all firm-level measures except firm age are negatively and significantly related to market value. Firm size is a negative and significant predictor of Tobin Q.' Table 5, models 1-3 also show 'lnasset' coefficients as negative and significant or trending towards it for TobinQ. Option D (Domestic Credit) is a country-level variable, not firm-level. Firm age is positive and significant. Market leverage is not consistently significant and negative.",

Section 2.3 'Model' also confirms: 'We estimate the influence of corruption perception and institutional quality on the performance of Nigerian firms via a dynamic panel data estimator... We use the One-Step Difference Generalized Method of Moment estimator for the study empirical analysis.' PCA was used to condense indicators for institutional quality, not as the primary analysis method.",

The data ranges from the period of 2012–2017'. The 2013-2017 timeframe is explicitly mentioned in the abstract for the analysis. The sample section later mentions 2012-2017. However, the initial statement in the abstract, and conclusion aligns with 2013-2017. The 2012-2017 is the data range, but for 135 listed companies the *timeframe* of the actual examination is specified as 2013-2017. Given the options, 135 companies and 2013-2017 is the most accurate summary of the *examined timeframe* in the key findings.",
